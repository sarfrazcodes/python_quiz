# python_quiz
Whole code is written in quiz.py file only as for now but soon will do changes and make it more valuable.
It's my first project in Python.
In this project I used lists, sets and some features of it used input() for taking input from the user and basic if - elif - statements used.
At the end it shows that what are the answers and what are the guesses which user did and under that score in percentage - corrected answers/total questions * 100.
This is just the start i am still learning and will come up with more good and valuable projects.
For the questions and answers in this quiz app i copy pasted from the internet.

In future will be looking for to add a GUI using tkinter or flask, with a separated json file so that everytime there will be a different set of questions in that.
