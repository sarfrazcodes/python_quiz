# python_quizzs
The project is a quiz application written in a single file called quiz.py. It uses lists and sets along with basic if-elif statements and input() to take answers from the user.
At the end of the quiz, it shows the correct answers, the user’s responses, and calculates the score as a percentage using the formula: (correct answers / total questions) * 100.

This is an initial version of the project. The questions and answers were sourced from the internet.
Future improvements include adding a GUI using Tkinter or Flask and storing questions in a separate JSON file so that different sets of questions can be used each time. The project can also be open for collaboration and contributions.
